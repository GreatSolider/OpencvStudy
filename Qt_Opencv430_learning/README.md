# Learn opencv4.3.0 in Qt5.14.2
1. Build the source of opencv4.3.0 with CMakeGUI3.17.2 and Qt's MinGW on win10 x64 platform.Here is the [built source](./opencv430ForQtBuild_win64).

    I don't know wheather this built source could be totally useful,maybe it causes some bugs.But until now, it works well for me.



This is just personal exercise.
